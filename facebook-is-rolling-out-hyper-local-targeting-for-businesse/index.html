As in, your immediate area. The search giant released a beta version of its service to help users find businesses that are near their physical location, as well as advertising local businesses.</p><p>Hyper-local targeting will be more of an extension of Facebook's current ad targeting functionality, which can break down potential customers for advertising by age, gender, and general location. Here's an example: say you are a small local bakery and want to advertise a new latte special that comes with a cookie. You can target age demographics in your area, and as users are walking in your general direction, Facebook will show them your ad so that you can offer them your special.</p><p>This feature seems to be designed to offset the damage caused by recent changes to the site, which have seen local businesses negatively affected by changes to Facebook's algorithms. But Facebook has been moving towards location-based targeting for a long time, so this comes as no surprise to those who saw the company's recent friend-geotargeting features. It was only a matter of time before local businesses could become part of the hyper-local focus that Facebook is now putting forward. Of course, there is an opt-out feature for the service: those who don't use Facebook's location-based services at all will not be affected by the new advertising content.</p><p>Is it worth it? It's a good question, and many of Facebook's advertising services operate on broadening a base to new potential customers. Still, local targeting is worth a lot to many different businesses, who rely on local clients to survive. Most businesses, particularly new businesses, could stand a lot to gain using Facebook's new local targeting ad service. It provides benefit to the user to see businesses which are in their area, and it benefits businesses making new customers who might not have seen them before.</p><p>Overall, location-based advertising makes a lot of sense, and helps even the playing field between smaller, local companies and much bigger ones with larger footprints. Users will probably notice it positively overall, as the overall experience of Facebook advertising is not changing, but the nature of that advertising will be more familiar and local. In short, if you are looking into advertising on Facebook and you have a local business, hyper-local advertising may be the path to the future.</p><picture>
