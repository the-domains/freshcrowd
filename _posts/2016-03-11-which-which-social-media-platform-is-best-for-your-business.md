When you have a small business, making sure that you are available on social media and knowing which platform is the right one for you makes all the difference. There are a few major social media platforms available to use, but by knowing your audience, you'll be able to reach an engaged base of customers and new clients by working with their preferences. It's not enough to have "just a Facebook page"-- you need to know how to use social media platforms effectively so that you can effectively expand the reach of your brand.

**Facebook**

The elephant in the room when it comes to social media, Facebook has the largest reach of any of the social media platforms. Even if Facebook isn't your primary social outlet, you should be available on Facebook for reviews, customer interaction and much more. Word of mouth is fairly strong on the social network as it is one where most Americans are already connected somehow. Facebook also has a very powerful advertising platform for hyper-local usage and is vital to having a successful online presence.

**Twitter**

Twitter is great for creating common-interest based fan engagement, but it takes a lot of work to make a single follower, so it's important to realize that it is driven by short bursts of interest (based on the way it works in 140 characters). Twitter is one of the trickier platforms to create an engaged base on, but if you do, the rewards are fantastic.

**Instagram and Pinterest**

Instagram and Pinterest to some degree belong together because they are both based on visuals. Companies like restaurants, museums, or lots of things to show off can do well by using the visual interest of the user base to create interest. There are other ways to use Instagram and Pinterest (sending visual messages to make a point) but in the end, this attracts users who are already interested in the visuals.

**Youtube and Periscope**

Youtube is an extremely useful assist when it comes to customer service, especially if you spend a lot of time with customers explaining values, benefits, and how things work when it comes to your business. With a video, you can save a lot of time and create a base of interested customers by showing your expertise when it comes to your product or service.

Youtube is also good for live video, but if you want to do live events, Periscope is becoming another service of value. It's easy to schedule, advertise and create Periscope videos for live events and demonstrations.

**LinkedIn**

Depending on the type of service you have, LinkedIn is good, particularly for professional connections. It is largely content driven, and allows you to become a thought leader among your peers. Especially for business to business networking, LinkedIn is generally unsurpassed in creating connections and making your online presence more visible.
