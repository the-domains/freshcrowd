How to Boost Likes for Free on Facebook
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ba1844de-ebbb-4ba5-9ddf-4e9c6876dd19.jpg)

Want to drive more "likes" to your Facebook page? Below are 3 different routes you can take to accomplish this. Did Fresh Crowd create your page and get you started on daily posting? We get asked all of the time, "how can I boost my business facebook likes organically?" 

We have listed the top 3 ways to increase your Facebook likes without having to pay a cent.

1\. 'SHARES' for CHARITY

Encourage customers to share and or like your Facebook page. By doing so, your business will donate a dollar per like or share to the charity of your choice.

2\. The 'GUMBALL' Jar

Place a jar full of gumballs at the front of your business and have customers guess the amount of gumballs in the jar. In order to enter the contest they must like and submit their guess onto your Facebook page for a chance to win a prize.

We would suggest taking a photo of the jar for your Facebook page as this will increase engagement. 

3\. Most REFERRALS Contest

Encourage your employees to tell the world about your Facebook page. When an employee refers someone to like the page, the 'liker' posts the employees name on the wall so you can track the referrals. Reward the top referral with a prize.
