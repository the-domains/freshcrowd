<p><strong><em>5 Reasons Why You're Not Gaining Traction on Social Media</em></strong></p><h3>Social Media Struggles?</h3><p>It is not so often that a small business has a social media strategy planned and perfected. Majority of business owners understand the importance of social media but do not have the time to invest into managing their social media channels. The trick to getting the most out of your social media platforms is momentum and ensuring you are managing your platforms effectively.</p><p>It's easy to get discouraged when getting the ball rolling on social. The followers may not be clicking those like icons, visiting your web site or engaging on your posts.</p><p>There is no need to worry, below you will find a list of reasons why your social media has yet to gain traction and what you can do about it.</p><p><b>1. You're Not Posting Everyday</b></p><p>Your competitors are out there posting daily and winning over the audience. If you are not out there posting enough then you are losing share of voice and its your competition that is top of mind. Posting here and there in big spurts simply doesn't cut it. You still need to continue posting to your channels to fill in the gaps with content that’s fresh and relevant. A strong strategy ensures that you’re active and anything short of that looks stale.</p><p><b>2. Lack of Monitoring</b></p><p>Monitoring your social channels can give your business a strong competitive advantage. Monitoring your channels allows you to easily touch base with potential customers or businesses you want to seek partnership with. Simply thanking a customer for a compliment or showing some love to another business by tagging them in a post goes a long way in the social world.</p><p><b>3. Too Much Promotion</b></p><p>Social Media is not a free advertising platform. Being overly promotional is the single biggest mistake you can make on your social feeds. Too much self promotion will get you no love from your followers. Social media is about building relationships with, and creating experiences for, your customers. Provide value and be mindful of your audience sparsely and tastefully.</p><p><b>4. Ignoring Customers</b></p><p>Customers on Facebook and Twitter are just as important as customers in person. When a customer asks a question on these platforms you need to be responding as soon as possible. Only checking your social media page here and there or for simple photo updates is not enough. Nurture your social media presence and watch the opportunities fall on your lap.</p><p><b>5. You Don't Have a Plan</b></p><p>The biggest mistake you can make is not having a social media plan at all. Your social channels become neglected, you assume that there is no ROI to be made on social and you are just wasting your time. Your competitors have formed a strategy and developed a plan and have left you in the dust.</p><p><a href="http://freshcrowd.com/">Fresh Crowd</a> is here for businesses that don't have the time or resources to manage your social media effectively.
